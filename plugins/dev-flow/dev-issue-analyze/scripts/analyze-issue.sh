# Line-anchored regex matching a markdown heading whose text CONTAINS one of the
# accepted AC-heading forms (case-insensitive), mirroring _lib/scripts/ac-lint.sh's
# HEADING_RE exactly: same alternation set (受け入れ基準|受け入れ条件|受入基準|
# 受入条件|Acceptance Criteria|完了条件) and the same "trailing text after the match is not
# required to end the line" tolerance (e.g. "受け入れ基準（Acceptance Criteria）"
# annotations match, and so does a substring like "受け入れ基準外" — same as
# ac-lint.sh), and the same heading-level range `#{2,6}` — an h1 `# 受け入れ基準`
# is NOT an AC heading here because ac-lint.sh (HEADING_RE, h2〜h6) does not accept
# it either; such a heading is surfaced via ac_heading_near_miss and handled by the
# sonnet fallback rather than silently dropped.
# This fast-path eligibility check MUST agree with ac-lint.sh's real
# contract gate, or the two silently diverge (an AC heading that one accepts and the
# other rejects makes the issue eligible on one path and AC-empty on the other).
# Substring matches like "受け入れ基準外" are accepted as ac-lint.sh does; see
# extract_ac_section below for how the *section body* is still correctly bounded at
# the *next heading of any kind* regardless of this looser heading match.
# NOTE: implemented with grep -E (not awk ==) — macOS's bundled awk (one true awk
# 20200816) has a confirmed locale-dependent bug where `==` between two non-identical
# multibyte Japanese strings (e.g. "受け入れ基準外" vs "受け入れ基準") spuriously

# scope / body_preview truncation (issue #596)
# ============================================================
# Both `scope` (contract mode + standard/comprehensive depth) and
# `body_preview` (standard/comprehensive depth) are capped for context-budget
# reasons. The caps themselves (4000 / 500) are an intentional design choice
# and are NOT changed here. What issue #596 fixes is that the truncation used
# to be silent: a spec written at the end of a long body could be cut with no
# trace, and analyze subagents (and humans debugging a repeated
# needs_clarification) had no way to tell "absent from excerpt" apart from
# "absent from issue". Every truncation now appends an explicit marker to the
# returned string AND emits a boolean + total-char-count pair so downstream
# consumers that only look at booleans (e.g. dev-flow.js's needs_clarification
# gate) still see the fact even if they never render the string.

# downstream analyze subagents read as an excerpt of the issue body.
