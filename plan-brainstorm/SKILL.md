# plan-brainstorm

Collaborative discovery for transforming vague ideas into concrete specifications.

## Usage

```
/plan-brainstorm [topic] [--depth shallow|normal|deep] [--parallel]
```

| Arg | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| topic | Subject to explore |
| --depth | shallow (quick), normal (standard), deep (comprehensive) |
| --parallel | Enable multi-persona parallel exploration |

## Workflow

1. **Clarify** → Ask 3-5 probing questions about the topic
2. **Explore** → Use Socratic dialogue to uncover hidden requirements
3. **Analyze** → Synthesize insights into structured findings
4. **Specify** → Generate actionable requirement brief

## Behavioral Principles

- **Socratic Dialogue**: Question-driven, never presumptive
- **Non-Directive**: Let user guide discovery direction
- **Progressive**: Build understanding incrementally
- **Documented**: Synthesize into structured briefs

## Question Categories

| Category | Example Questions |
|----------|------------------|
| Problem | What problem does this solve? Who experiences it? |
| Users | Who are target users? What are their workflows? |
| Scope | What's in/out of scope? MVP vs full vision? |
| Technical | Existing systems? Integration requirements? |
| Constraints | Timeline? Budget? Team capabilities? |
